# 📐 Statistical Modeling & Inference

A repository dedicated to statistical methodology and quantitative research. This code supports the work done during my Masters in Statistics and Data Science at University of Hasselt.

## 📚 Topics Covered
1.  **Linear Modelling:** - A complete workflow on crops data where we investigate the relationship between yield, nitrogen and rainfall. We examine quadratic effects, interactions and finally choose the best model to go for the data available. 
2.  **Simulations:**
3.  **Longitudinal Data Analysis:**
   
## 🧮 Methodology
Mathematical formulations and derivation notes are provided in the `.Rmd` files.
